        <h2><a name="Dad">My Father</a></h2>

	<p>This is my dad, Othman Awang. Others call him either Othman, Man, or Poksu, but my siblings and I call him Ayah. When we were growing up, Ayah was the most chill person I've ever known. He never got angry over small things.</p> 
	<p>However, if you did something really bad, then he would get upset with you, but seeing him angry was very rare. Ayah's calm demeanor was something we all admired and respected.</p>
	<p>My dad is born on January 9th 1962, thats mean hes a Capricon</p>
        <p>As a Capricorn born on January 9th, my dad likely exhibits traits associated with this zodiac sign, such as determination, responsibility, and a practical approach to life. Capricorns are often known for their grounded nature and strong work ethic, traits that may have contributed to my dad's ability to handle difficult situations with grace and patience.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 align=right><a name="Mom">My Mother</a></h2>

	<p>This is my mom, Maziah Taib. Others call her Maziah, Yah, or Moksu, but my siblings and I call her Mak. Mak is actually the opposite of Ayah when we were growing up. She would scold you if you were sleeping late, late for breakfast, and many more. But looking back now, we start to understand why Mom would scold us if we did something late or bad.</p>
	<p>Mak's discipline was her way of teaching us responsibility and the importance of being punctual. Despite her strictness, Mak always showed us love and care in her own way.</p>
	<p>My Mom is born on January 8th 1968, thats mean she's also a Capricon.</p>
        <p>As a fellow Capricorn born on January 8th, my mom likely shares some characteristics with my dad, such as practicality and a strong sense of duty. However, she may also exhibit traits like organization, determination, and a no-nonsense attitude, which could explain her emphasis on discipline and structure within the family.</p>
