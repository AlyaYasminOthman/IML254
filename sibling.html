            <h2><a name="Abg De">Abang De</h2>
            <p>Mohammad Faisal, the third eldest sibling, is full of energy and curiosity. He has a passion for learning and is always eager to try new things and explore new ideas. he also can be secretive type of person. When we were kids we always fighting and he always said that I was adopted and he didn't want me as his sister. Me being a kid at that time will go cry at my mom because of what he said but my mom just laugh at it, but now when he said I was adopted I will fight him back and then we will cool off just like that. No apologies or what so ever.</p>
<br>
            <p>Even though we look like we hate each other but actually we care for one another we just don't really express it.Making people wonder do we fight all the time. He is also the type of person that hardly takes picture of himself and it really hard to find his picture to be honest.</p>
